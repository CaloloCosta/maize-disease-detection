# maize-disease-detection
Machine learning model that detects disease on maize leaves

This model was built as part of the indabaX Namibia 2022 hackathon.  

## Objectives
The dataset consists of images of helthy and unhelthy maize, from that dataset the model should be able to identify healthy and unhelthy maize
- The model should not accept any other image except of a maize
- Suggest diseases remedies
- Explain what causes the disease
- Detect healthy and affected maize
- Create data visualization
- Explain the model
- Evaluate and validating the model
- Overfitting & underfitting
